Two components do creating navigation element with several links.
One component renders desktop navigation (horizontal bar with links), while the other renders mobile menu (vertically) which by default is closed. Clicking the hamburger icon opens mobile menu with additional button to close it.
The two components are rendered depending on the screen size.

The settings used for this project are suitable for development only and very convenient for learning because they use in-browser babel compiler. The project was verified using http-server.
